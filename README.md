Machine Learning Project based on Market Timing using Linear Regression Model.


Historical daily prices were taken from Yahoo Finance.  It provides financial news, data and commentary including stock quotes, press releases, financial reports and original content.  We can make use of it to fetch the stock price of companies for any time range with a maximum limit. It allows to download CSV file containing the stock data. In this project, the stock data from 2014-2022 is used for model training and testing.


In order to evaluate the Linear regression technique of ML, it is sufficient to show that the predicted model fits the data as accurately as possible. Showing how well the model fits can therefore demonstrate that the method can be extended to predict actual future value. In this project, a Simple Linear Regression in One Variable is considered, namely the Closing Stock price for the prediction and initially plotted into the graph using plot() function.  A linear model was later fit to this graph, displayed and observations were made. The data from 2014-2019 is trained being the In-sample data and the data from 2019-2022 (out of sample) is tested.

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. 
A simple linear regression equation is y= mx+b, whereas m is the slope/gradient of the polynomial of the line aka y (predict coefficient) and b is the intercept of the line (bias coefficient).
